In this post 'Practical Machine Learning with R and Python - Part 3' I discuss 'Feature Selection' methods. This post is a continuation of my 2 earlier posts

While applying Machine Learning techniques the data set will usually include a large number of predictors for a target variable. It is likely that not all the predictor or feature variables will have an impact on the output. Hence it is becomes necessary to choose only those features which influence the output variable thus simplying the reduced feature set on which to train the ML model on.  The techiniques that are used are the following

- Best fit 
- Forward fit 
- Backward fit
- Ridge Regression or L2 regularization
- Lasso or L1 regularization

All these methods remove those features which do not sufficiently influence  the output.

# 1.1 Best Fit
For a dataset with features f1,f2,f3...fn, the 'Best fit' approach, chooses all possible combinations of features and creates separate ML models for each of the different combinations. The best fit algotithm then  uses some filtering  criteria based on Adj Rsquared, Cp, BIC or AIC to pick out the best model among all models.

Since the Best Fit approach searches the entire solution space it is computationally infeasible. The number of models that have to be searched increase exponentially as the number of predictors increase. For 'p' predictors a total of  latex 2^{p} ML models have to be searched. This can be shown as follows

There are latex C_{1} ways to choose single feature ML models among 'n' features, latex C_{2} ways to choose 2 feature models among 'n' models and so on, or

C_{1} + C_{2} +.... + C_{n}= Total number of models in Best Fit
Since from Binomail theorem we have 
 $(1+x)^{n} = 1+C_{1}x + C_{2} +... + C_{n}$  --- (1)

When x=1 in the equation (1) above, this becomes
2^{n} = 1+C_{1}x + C_{2} +... + C_{n}

Hence there are 2^{n} models to search amongs in Best Fit. For 10 features this is  2^{10} or ~1000 models and for 40 features this becoms 2^{40} which almost 1 trillion. Usually there are datasets with 1000 or maybe even 100000 features and Best fit becomes computationally infeasible.


Anyways I have included the Best Fit approach as I use the Boston crime datasets which is available both the MASS package in R and Sklearn in Python and it has 13 features. Even this small feature set takes a bit of time since the Best fit needs to search among ~2^{13}= 8192 models

Initially I perform a simple Linear Regression Fit to estimate the features that are statistically insignificant. By looking at the p-values of the features it can be 
seen that 'indus' and 'age' features have high p-values and are not significant

# 1.1a Linear Regression - R code
```{r fig1,cache=TRUE}
source('RFunctions-1.R')
#Read the Boston crime data
df=read.csv("Boston.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Data from MASS - SL
# Rename the columns
names(df) <-c("no","crimeRate","zone","indus","charles","nox","rooms","age",
              "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")
# Select specific columns
df1 <- df %>% dplyr::select("crimeRate","zone","indus","charles","nox","rooms","age",
                            "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")
dim(df1)
# Linear Regression fit
fit <- lm(cost~. ,data=df1)
summary(fit)

```

Next we apply the different feature selection models to automatically remove features that are not significant below

# 1.1a Best Fit - R code

The Best Fit requires the 'leaps' R package
```{r}
library(leaps)
source('RFunctions-1.R')
#Read the Boston crime data
df=read.csv("Boston.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Data from MASS - SL
# Rename the columns
names(df) <-c("no","crimeRate","zone","indus","charles","nox","rooms","age",
              "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")
# Select specific columns
df1 <- df %>% dplyr::select("crimeRate","zone","indus","charles","nox","rooms","age",
                            "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")

# Perform a best fit
bestFit=regsubsets(cost~.,df1,nvmax=13)

# Generate a summary of the fit
bfSummary=summary(bestFit)

# Plot the Residual Sum of Squares vs number of variables 
plot(bfSummary$rss,xlab="Number of Variables",ylab="RSS",type="l",main="Best fit RSS vs No of features")
# Get the index of the minimum value
a=which.min(bfSummary$rss)
# Mark this in red
points(a,bfSummary$rss[a],col="red",cex=2,pch=20)

# Plot the CP statistic vs Number of variables
plot(bfSummary$cp,xlab="Number of Variables",ylab="Cp",type='l',main="Best fit Cp vs No of features")
# Find the lowest CP value
b=which.min(bfSummary$cp)
# Mark this in red
points(b,bfSummary$cp[b],col="red",cex=2,pch=20)


# Display the set of features which provide the best fit
coef(bestFit,b)

#  Plot the BIC value
plot(bfSummary$bic,xlab="Number of Variables",ylab="BIC",type='l',main="Best fit BIC vs No of Features")
# Find and mark the min value
c=which.min(bfSummary$bic)
points(c,bfSummary$bic[c],col="red",cex=2,pch=20)

# R has some other good plots for best fit
plot(bestFit,scale="r2",main="Rsquared vs No Features")

plot(bestFit,scale="Cp",main="Cp vs NoFeatures")

plot(bestFit,scale="bic",main="BIC vs Features")

```

## 1.1b Best fit (Exhaustive Search ) - Python code
The Python package for performing a Best Fit is the Exhaustive Feature Selector [EFS](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/ExhaustiveFeatureSelector/).
```{python cache=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from mlxtend.feature_selection import ExhaustiveFeatureSelector as EFS

# Read the Boston crime data
df = pd.read_csv("Boston.csv",encoding = "ISO-8859-1")

#Rename the columns
df.columns=["no","crimeRate","zone","indus","chasRiver","NO2","rooms","age",
              "distances","idxHighways","taxRate","teacherRatio","color","status","cost"]
# Set X and y 
X=df[["crimeRate","zone","indus","chasRiver","NO2","rooms","age",
              "distances","idxHighways","taxRate","teacherRatio","color","status"]]
y=df['cost']

# Perform an Exhaustive Search. The EFS and SFS packages use 'neg_mean_squared_error'. The 'mean_squared_error' seems to have been deprecated. I think this is just the MSE with the a negative sign.
lr = LinearRegression()
efs1 = EFS(lr, 
           min_features=1,
           max_features=13,
           scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
           print_progress=True,
           cv=5)


# Create a efs fit
efs1 = efs1.fit(X.as_matrix(), y.as_matrix())

print('Best negtive mean squared error: %.2f' % efs1.best_score_)
## Print the IDX of the best features 
print('Best subset:', efs1.best_idx_)
```

# 1.2 Forward fit
Forward fit is a greedy algorithm that tries to optimize the feature selected, by minimizing the selection criteria (adj Rsqaured, Cp, AIC or BIC) at every step. For a dataset with features f1,f2,f3...fn, the forward fit starts with the NULL set. It then pick the ML model with a single feature from n features  which has the highest adj Rsquared, or minimum Cp, BIC or some such criteria.  After picking the 1 feature from n which satisfies the criteria the most, the next feature from the remaining n-1 features is chosen. When the 2 feature model which satisfies the selection criteria the best is chosen, another feature from the remaining n-2 features are added and so on. The forward fit is a sub-optimal algorithm. There is no guarantee that the final list of features chosen will be the best among the lot. The computation required for this is of 
n + n-1 + n-2 + ...1 = n(n+1)/2 which is of the order of n^{2}. Though forward fit is a sub optimal solution it is far more computationally efficient than best fit


## 1.2a Forward fit - R code
Forward fit in R determines that 11 features are required for the best fit. The features are shown below

```{r fig2,cache=TRUE}
library(leaps)
# Read the data
df=read.csv("Boston.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Data from MASS - SL
# Rename the columns
names(df) <-c("no","crimeRate","zone","indus","charles","nox","rooms","age",
              "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")

# Select columns
df1 <- df %>% dplyr::select("crimeRate","zone","indus","charles","nox","rooms","age",
                     "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")

#Split as training and test 
train_idx <- trainTestSplit(df1,trainPercent=75,seed=5)
train <- df1[train_idx, ]
test <- df1[-train_idx, ]

# Find the best forward fit
fitFwd=regsubsets(cost~.,data=train,nvmax=13,method="forward")

# Compute the MSE
valErrors=rep(NA,13)
test.mat=model.matrix(cost~.,data=test)
for(i in 1:13){
    coefi=coef(fitFwd,id=i)
    pred=test.mat[,names(coefi)]%*%coefi
    valErrors[i]=mean((test$cost-pred)^2)
}

# Plot the Residual Sum of Squares
plot(valErrors,xlab="Number of Variables",ylab="Validation Error",type="l",main="Forward fit RSS vs No of features")
# Gives the index of the minimum value
a<-which.min(valErrors)
print(a)
# Highlight the smallest value
points(c,valErrors[a],col="blue",cex=2,pch=20)

#Print the 11 ccoefficients
coefi=coef(fitFwd,id=i)
coefi
```

## 1.2b Forward fit with Cross Validation - R code
The Python package SFS includes N Fold Cross Validation errors for forward and backward fit
so I decided to add this code to R. This is not available in the leaps R package, however the implementation is quite simple. Another implementation is also available at [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about), Prof Trevor Hastie & Prof Robert Tibesherani, Online Stanford

    folds = sample(1:noFolds, nrow(df1), replace=TRUE) 
    cv<-0
    # Loop through the folds
    for(j in 1:noFolds){
        # The training is all rows for which the row is != j (k-1 folds -> training)
        train <- df1[folds!=j,]
        # The rows which have j as the index become the test set

        coefi=coef(fitFwd,id=i)
        #Get the value of the test data
        test.mat=model.matrix(cost~.,data=test)
        # Multiply the tes data with teh fitted coefficients to get the predicted value

        rss=mean((test$cost - pred)^2)
        # Add all the Cross Validation errors

```

## 1.2b Forward fit - Python code
The Backward Fit in Python uses the  Sequential feature selection (SFS) package (SFS)(https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/SequentialFeatureSelector/)
**Note:** The Cross validation error for SFS in Sklearn is negative, possibly because it computes
the 'neg_mean_squared_error'. The earlier 'mean_squared_error' in the package seems to have been deprecated.  I have taken the -ve of this neg_mean_squared_error. I think this
would give mean_squared_error.

## 1.3 Backward Fit
Backward fit belongs to the class of greedy algorithms which  tries to optimize the feature set, by dropping a feature at every stage which results in the worst performance for a given criteria of Adj RSquared, Cp, BIC or AIC.  For a dataset with features f1,f2,f3...fn, the backward fit starts with the all the features f1,f2.. fn to begin with. It then pick the ML model with a n-1 features  by dropping the feature,f_{j}, for e.g., the inclusion of which results in the worst performance in adj Rsquared, or minimum Cp, BIC or some such criteria.  At every step 1 feature is dopped. There is no guarantee that the final list of features chosen will be the best among the lot. The computation required for this is of 
n + n-1 + n -2 + .. 1 = n(n+1)/2 which is of the order of n^{2}. Though backward fit is a sub optimal solution it is far more computationally efficient than best fit

## 1.3c Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) - Python code
The Sequential Feature search also includes 'floating' variants which include or exclude features conditionally, once they were excluded or included. The SFFS can conditionally include features which were excluded from the previous step, if it results in a better fit. This option will tend to a better solution, than plain simple SFS. These variants are included below

# 1.4 Ridge regression
In Linear Regression the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) is given as
RSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_jx_{ij})^{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_jx_{ij})^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta^{2}

where \lambda  is the regularization or tuning parameter. Increasing \lambda increases the penalty on the coefficients thus shrinking them. However in Ridge Regression features that do not influence the target variable will shrink closer to zero but never become zero except for very large values of \lambda

Ridge regression in R requires the 'glmnet' package

## 1.4a Ridge Regression - R code
```{r}
library(glmnet)
library(dplyr)
# Read the data
df=read.csv("Boston.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Data from MASS - SL
#Rename the columns

              "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")

                            "distances","highways","tax","teacherRatio","color","status","cost")

# Set X and y as matrices
X=as.matrix(df1[,1:13])
y=df1$cost

# Fit a Ridge model
fitRidge <-glmnet(X,y,alpha=0)

#Plot the model where the coefficient shrinkage is plotted vs log lambda
plot(fitRidge,xvar="lambda",label=TRUE,main= "Ridge regression coefficient shrikage vs log lambda")

# Compute the cross validation error
cvRidge=cv.glmnet(X,y,alpha=0)

#Plot the cross validation error
plot(cvRidge, main="Ridge regression Cross Validation Error (10 fold)")

# 1.5 Lasso 
The Lasso is another form of regularization, also known as L1 regularization. Unlike the Ridge Regression where the coefficients of features which do not influence the target tend to zero, in the lasso regualrization the coefficients become 0. The general form of Lasso is as follows
\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_jx_{ij})^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}|\beta|\\
